# aklive2d

A project that builds showcase webpage for Arknights Live2D-equipped operators. Showcase webpage can be used as a wallpaper for Wallpaper Engine on Windows or [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash) on macOS (not tested).

## Supported Operators

| Operator | Live Preview | Steam Workshop |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Skadi the Corrupting Heart | [Link](https://arknights.halyul.dev/skadi/) | [Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2492307783) |

- For Windows users: Use [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) or other softwares that support using webpage as desktop wallpaper.
- For macOS users: Use [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash), however, I don't have macOS machine, so your mileage may vary.
- For Linux users: You power user should be able to find your solutions!
